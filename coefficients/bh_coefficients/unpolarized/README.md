# Fourier Coefficients for the Unpolarized Target in the Bethe-Heitler Process:

There are (thankfully) only three coefficients that come into play in the Bethe-Heitler process when the target is **unpolarized**. These do not change from across the BKM02 formalism to the BKM10 formalism.

**Important Note**: 

The BH coefficients remain the same across the BKM02 and BKM10 formalisms because it is a "contamination" of the total amplitude squared. Please read the following justification in the BKM10 formalism:

> ...the Bethe-Heitler contribution $|\mathcal{T}^{BH}|^{2}$ is merely an undesirable contamination which was computed exactly already in Ref. [3] and can be subtracted from the cross section making use of the
available vast data on the nucleon electromagnetic form factors measured at facilities around the
world.
